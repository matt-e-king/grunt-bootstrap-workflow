Grunt Bootstrap Workflow
Ready to go, uncompiled, Grunt - Bootstrap workflow.

When you download Bootstrap 3 uncompiled you still get a lot of "crap" that the creators of Bootstrap were using specifically for the Bootstrap 3 website.

This package is exactly what you would get from the Bootstrap 3 uncompiled downloaded, minus all that crap, and some extras.

This package contains all the Grunt modules that are listed in the paskage.json file, so there is no need to npm anything. I also modified the "bootstrap.less" file so it contains animation.less from this guy http://daneden.me/animate/

If you are looking to create a "theme" based on the Grunt - Bootstrap workflow that the cool folks at Twitter put together this is a good place ot start. I will eventually put some step by step insutrctions on here for getting started.
